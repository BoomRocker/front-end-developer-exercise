# Ramsey Solutions Front End Evaluation
Thank you for the opportunity to get back to writing code! It's been a year or so as I have been managing teams of UX, Front End Dev, Analysts, and Project Managers!

## Updates
Made it awesome
* Zeroed out Margins for all browsers
* Used fonts from Google Fonts
* https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro
* https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans
* I used Box Shadow around the content area. I tried to use Inset for the Aside Nav Baby Steps but could not get it do just the left side in the time I had so I used the PNG.
* To make the most of the code length I used background images for the top header and instead of flat text used actual text for H1,H2,H3 tags to improve SEO and accessibility.
* I tweaked and re saved down the shadow_left.jpg image as it was not the correct gradient.
* I decided to use ColorZilla to make the background gradient for faster speed.

## Installation
